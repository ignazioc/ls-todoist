# LS-Todoist
This ruby script automatically creates tasks basewd on the list of files in a folder.

## Why?
Because you may have videos you want to watch, document you want to go through and having them in one single place is awesome.

## How?
Define an environment variable with your todoist security token: click [here](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations) to find your token 
```bash
export todoist_token=<your token>
```

Run the script passing your path

```bash
./ls-toidst.rb -p ~/Desktop/VideosToWatch
```

The script will ask you to select one of your project:

```
Select your project: (Use arrow keys, press Enter to select)
‚Ä£ Inbox
  ‚≠êÔ∏è ls-todois
  üì± WWDC2018
  üíª RWDevConf
  üóΩ Liberty
(Move up or down to reveal more choices)
```

Then you can decide the frequency of the tasks:

```
How many days between each task? (1)
```
